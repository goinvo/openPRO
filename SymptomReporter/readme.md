# Symptom Reporter
The Symptom Reporter helps a patient distill and clarify subjective symptoms and experiences into structured data that can be conveniently and consistently shared with clinicians in person, via email/text, or the Electronic Medical Record. Foreign language support will help patients prepare a report in English before an appointment so they can be more comfortable and confident in communicating their experiences and needs.

Similar products exist, but there are important differences. There are many online symptom checking tools (WebMD.com, Isabel symptomchecker.isabelhealthcare.com) that focus on providing a home diagnosis. Symptom trackers are popular mobile apps that allow a patient to keep tabs on a chronic or recurring symptom over time. Neither of these types of application focuses on aiding communication or creating a detailed and medically relevant report at the point of pain. The most similar app available is AHRQuestionBuilder, developed by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Some patient portals integrate a symptom checker (Epic - Mayo Clinicâ€™s MyChart), but again, it does not provide any way to begin a conversation with a clinician regarding those symptoms. Hopefully, an open source tool such as openPRO - Symptom Reporter would help encourage such integration.
